jobs.post-command.enabled::
	Toggle whether maintenance processes should start at the end of
	some Git commands. By default, Git runs `git gc --auto` at the
	end of some common commands, such as `git fetch` or `git commit`.
	The `gc.auto` config option can disable the `git gc --auto`
	command from doing any meaningful work, but the process is still
	launched despite that option. When `jobs.post-command.enabled`
	is `false`, then these processes will not start at all. The
	default value is `true`.
